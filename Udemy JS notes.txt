		Code along with the instructor. 
		Attempt ALL coding challenges. Only view solution as a last resort.
		Take notes. Take lots of notes. 
		No need to know exactlly why things work in the beginning. Just learn.
		Before moving on from a section, review and try to make sure I understand.

    Video: 6. Section intro 
    Video: 7, Hello world
    Video: 8, A brief introduction to Javascript
        Javascript is a high-level object-oriented, multi-paradigm, programming language
        ?
        JS tells computers to do stuff. 
        Highlevel (I don't need to worry about machine Code)
        Multi-paradigm, basically it's versatile and flexible

        What is JS even used for?
        the big 3, HTML CSS JS the bones of the internet
        HTML is the nouns
        CSS describes the noun
        JS is the verb, like 'hide' the noun
        Essentially any effect you see on the web, JS makes it happen
        JS adds dynamic effects on pages and build applications.
        JS is lightweight and is a rep of modern web dev.
        Angular, is an example of a framework. They still use JS
        JS is the 'low-level' of most webframeworks. It is good to know
        node.js allows Web applications to run on the backend
        JS can make 'Native' desktop and mobile apps.

        ***I am learning the most recent javascript release
        ES6/ES2015 is the most recesnt ECMAScript released. 
    
    Video: 9, Linking a Javascript File 

        Grab the starter code,(I already pulled it using git )

    Video: 10, Values and Variables

        let or var are needed to name variables 
        varialbe names may NOT start with an integer
        be specific in naming varialbes. 
        and be wary of reserved names.
        Be descriptive in variable names.

    Video 12. Data Types.

        Data can have different types.

        Value can have 2 types. Object, and anything else is Primative

        Primative Data Types
        - Number: Floating point numbers, Integers, and decimals. In JS
        - String: Sequence of characters used for text.
        - Boolean: Logic type, is True or False
        - Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined (empty Value)
        - Null: Also means 'empty value'
        - Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed (Not useful for now)
        - BigInt (ES2020): Large integers that the Number type can't hold.

        JS has dynamic typing: We do not have to declare the kind of datatype a variable is.
        Value has type, NOT variable

    Video 17. String Template 

        Template literals are like = `${variable}`
        `` may be used as regular with javascript
        \n means newline character. Useful for make a new line of characters

    Video 18. if / else statments

    if else control structure looks like:
    if(){

    }else {

    }
    *****
    JS does not run code in a linear fashion. This will give us more 
    control.
